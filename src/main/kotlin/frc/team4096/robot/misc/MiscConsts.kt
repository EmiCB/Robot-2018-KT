	Pressure's weak
	Intake's heavy
	Dirt on his wheels already
	Overload me! (Code's spaghetti)

	But on the outside he looks fierce, Atla-Z
	To carry cubes
	But he keeps on droppin
	When he broke down, the whole crowd groans so loud
	He closes his valve, but the air just leaks out
	He's broken now, Ctrl-Z is mopin' now
	The power's run out, scale's pressin down

	Snap back to the tragedy, oh there goes the battery
	Oh there goes belt, it broke
	He's so bad but he won't be fixed easy, no
